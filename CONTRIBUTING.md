Contributing to diemuzi.com
===========================

As an open source project, Diemuzi welcomes contributions of many forms.

Examples of contributions include:

* Code patches
* Documentation improvements
* Bug reports and patch reviews

Diemuzi uses [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/diemuzi/diemuzi.com/issues) to keep track of 
bugs, feature requests, and associated patches.
Patches can be submitted as pull requests, but if you don't file a ticket,
it's unlikely that we'll notice your contribution.
